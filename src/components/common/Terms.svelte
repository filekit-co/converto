    </h3>
    <p>
      filekit Signature permits documents to be signed by one’s self or one can
      request for signatures from other users by means of email delivery.
      Signers will have the ability to review the document before proceeding
      with the application of a signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requester has the option to send a simple electronic signature request
      or can activate the certified signature option in order to place an EIDAS
      listed TimeStamp for added legal validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the final version of the document, we provide an Audit
      Trail that includes details gathered from the requester as well as the
      signers in order to provide greater transparency to the entire process.
    </p>
    <p>
      All documents containing certified signatures are stored in filekit’s
      servers for safekeeping for procurement purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that once the signature process is complete, it is you who
      have the sole authority to safeguard the document/s.
