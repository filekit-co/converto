      Users have the sole responsibility for the utilization of their own files
    </p>
    <p>
      filekit's role is restricted to providing users with access to their
      processed files. These files will be stored on our servers only for the
      duration that the download link remains available.

    <h3 class="title3">
      <a />3.2 Content manipulation
    </h3>
    <p>
      filekit ensures the provision of comprehensive information to aid users in
      file processing. However, the user alone bears the responsibility for
      reaching out to filekit in case of any technical issues. filekit places
      great emphasis on file security, as evidenced by its strategically
      positioned servers with limited access and robust safeguards. Users retain
      the flexibility to modify their User type or cancel their account at any
      time using the contact form.
    </p>

    <h3 class="title3">
      <a />3.3 Responsibility for the content of the files
    </h3>
    <p>
      filekit does not analyze the content of processed files and thus is not
      responsible for its tools misuse nor copyright infringements which may
      affect third- parties. The User will be responsible before filekit of any
      penalty, sanction, and/or fine which the courts or other competent
      authorities could issue against filekit for noncompliance with any part of
      this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, users are obligated to utilize the Service in compliance
      with prevailing laws and adhere to the aforementioned rules outlined in
      section 1.1.
    </p>

    <div class="sideinfo">
      <p>
        We do not access or analyze the content of your files. If you encounter
        any technical issues, it is your responsibility to contact us. We do not

      <a />4. Signature
    </h2>

    <h3 class="title3">
      <a />4.1 How it works
    </h3>
    <p>
      filekit Signature enables users to sign their own documents or request
      signatures from other users via email delivery. Signers are given the
      opportunity to review the document before applying their signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requester can choose to send a simple electronic signature request or
      activate the certified signature option, which includes an EIDAS listed
      TimeStamp to enhance legal validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, along with the final version of the document, we offer an
      Audit Trail that captures details from the requester and signers, ensuring
      transparency throughout the entire process.
    </p>
    <p>
      All documents containing certified signatures are securely stored on
      filekit's servers for procurement purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be aware that once the signature process is completed, you are
      solely responsible for safeguarding the document(s).
    </p>

    <h3 class="title3">
      <a />4.2 Legal Guarantees
    </h3>
    <p>
      filekit endeavors to ensure that its services adhere to the requirements
      outlined in the U.S. Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce
      Act of 2000 (ESIGN), the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), and
      the European Union eIDAS (EU No.910/2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer a comprehensive audit trail, certified signatures, timestamps,
      and signature biometric tracing, all of which hold legal significance in
      jurisdictions worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      If necessary, filekit is prepared to provide the certified document and
      audit trail as mandated by a court of law. However, we cannot be held
      liable if the document is not upheld or deemed insufficient.
    </p>

    <h3 class="title3"><a />4.3 Pricing</h3>
    <p>
      filekit provides two distinct types of signatures: e-signatures and
      certified signatures. e-Signatures are available for free, but may be
      subject to limitations on processing size or quantity (refer to pricing
      for additional information). Premium users receive a predetermined number
      of certified signatures each month at no extra cost, and we also offer
      prepaid packs for additional purchase. These packs allow the use of
      certificates beyond those included with your subscription or previously
      acquired packs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="title3">
      <a />4.4 Collected Information
    </h3>
    <p>
      To ensure complete transparency during the signature process, filekit may
      gather the following information for the audit trail, which will be
      accessible to all relevant parties:

      the same amount they subscribed to. Your payment method will be charged
      until you cancel your subscription, unless specified otherwise. The
      service will be billed based on the acquisition date and cost. You have
      the option to cancel your subscription at any time, but the cancellation
      will be effective at the end of the current billing period, and no refund
